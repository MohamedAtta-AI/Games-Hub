# Games-Hub
A Pygame project that integrates a platformer game and a tic-tac-toe game.
Run main_menu to start.

Note: You have to add your own "bread.wav" file in the sounds folder as the original one was too big.


This was made as a course project for Python programming in my freshman year :) where I:
- Made the platformer game
- Integrated both games into one GUI
